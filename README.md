# Physics-Informed-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Indoor-Wi-Fi-Access-Point-Placement

- Designed and developed a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model to predict the power map that indicates received signal strength (RSS) in an indoor environment based on given WAP locations.
- Implemented a 4-layer CNN (discriminator) and the GAN model training framework.
- Achieved final pixel-wise accuracy 78.02% for testing dataset and improved average runtime by 99.02%.
- Accepted and published by 2021 IEEE AP-S/URSI Technical Program Committee.
